    Amongst the most notable features of the city are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_B%C3%A1rbara_Castle" title="Santa Bárbara Castle is a fortification in the center of Alicante, Spain"> Castle of Santa Bárbara</a>, which sits high above the city, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Alicante" title="The Port of Alicante is a seaport in Alicante, Spain on the Mediterranean Sea used for commercial and passenger traffic"> Port of Alicante </a>. The latter was the subject of bitter controversy in 2006–2007 as residents battled, successfully, to keep it from being changed into an industrial estate.

    The All Terrain Tactical Executor (AT-TE), sometimes also known as tanks by <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/es/wiki/Soldado_clon/Leyendas" title="What is a clone trooper">clone troopers</a>, was an all-terrain assault walker developed for the Grand Army of the Republic (GER) during the Clone Wars. The walker was used for numerous tasks, including but not limited to transporting platoons of clone troopers on the battlefield and attacking enemy installations. The rear compartment of the AT-TE contained holographic communication devices and a space for soldiers to stand during transport. At the back of the machine was a large door that allowed soldiers to be quickly deployed into battle. Some versions of the walker were capable of scaling vertical cliffs, as evidenced at the Battle of Teth. The typical AT-TE arsenal included a top-mounted mass conductor cannon, along with six other laser cannons strategically placed around the outside of the vehicle.</p>

AT-TEs were first used in the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Due to the vehicle's success in battle, Rothana designed numerous walkers for use in the GER. The walker served in countless battles across the galaxy and eventually became part of the Imperial Army after the Republic's transformation into the Galactic Empire. The AT-TE was a precursor to the Empire's All Terrain Armored Transport.

    The AT-TE was a multi-purpose assault vehicle, capable of tasks ranging from transporting platoons of clone troopers around the battlefield to large-scale attacks against enemy installations. Another function that the vehicle could also perform was to provide covering fire for battalions of soldiers. AT-TEs were often deployed in large numbers to overwhelm the enemy through a large volume of fire.

    The internal rear compartment included a series of computers that included a holographic communication system that allowed representations of the commanders to be projected inside the vehicle. In the standard model, soldiers could exit the vehicle through a hatch at the back of the walker. The compartment was also capable of storing two AT-RTs that could be deployed through a larger landing door.[

    Some AT-TE were impervious to ion cannon damage due to the incorporation of an electromagnetic shield. Its average speed was 60 km/h (37.2 m/h). This slow pace allowed it to penetrate energy shields, a feat that was impossible for repulsor vehicles. Effective in numerous terrains and environments, some of the walker models were even used to scale vertical cliffs, similar to the later UT-AT transport.[15][16] During the Battle of Bothawui, the AT-TE was even shown to be useful in space combat, when a contingent of walkers were deployed to asteroids to ambush a Separatist fleet.[17] The AT-TEs contained enough fuel to travel at full speed for more than 500 kilometers and had enough fresh air and military rations to keep their crew alive for three weeks in the harsh conditions of the battlefield.
