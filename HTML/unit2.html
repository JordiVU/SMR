  <h2 id=important> Doctors without borders</h2>
  <p>
    In <strong> May 1968 </strong>, a group of <strong> young doctors </strong> decided to go and <strong> help victims of wars </strong> and major disasters. This <strong> new brand of humanitarianism </strong> would reinvent the concept of emergency aid. They were to become <strong> Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) </strong>, known internationally in English as <strong> Doctors Without Borders. </strong>
  </p>

  <h2 id=people>People first</h2>
  <p>
    MSF was officially created on December 22, 1971. At the time, 300 volunteers made up the organization: <em>doctors, nurses, and other staff, including the 13 founding doctors and journalists. </em>
  </p>

  <p>
MSF was created on the belief that all people have the right to medical care regardless of <em>gender, race, religion, creed, or political affiliation </em>, and that the needs of these people outweigh respect for national boundaries.
